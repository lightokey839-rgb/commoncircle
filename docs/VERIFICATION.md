# CommonCircle verification ledger

Updated: 2026-11-10 (Africa/Lagos)

This ledger is evidence-first. `UNVERIFIED` and `BLOCKED` entries are not README
claims. No private keys, seed phrases, access tokens, or populated `.env` data
belong here.

## Spec and repository gates

| Check | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read the authoritative v3 spec completely | PASS | `C:\Users\HomePC\Downloads\CommonCircle on NEAR Feature Spec (v3).md`, 322 lines, read on 2026-11-10; committed as `docs/COMMONCIRCLE_SPEC_v3.md` |
| v3 supersedes v2 | PASS | v3 line 3 explicitly supersedes v2; v3 is now the repository authority |
| Official hackathon rules page | PASS (rules read, no submission claim) | Read 2026-11-10: https://nearhackathon.com/ states build window 1 Nov 2026 00:00 UTC to 14 Nov 2026 23:59 UTC, public repository and public X demo are required, multi-track submission is allowed, and the prior criteria are technical implementation, design, impact, originality and sustainability |
| Tiered A/B/C gate timing | PASS (schedule recorded) | v3: Gate 0 Tue 10 Nov 23:59 UTC; Gate 1 Wed 11 Nov 23:59; Gate 2 Thu 12 Nov 23:59; Gate 3 Fri 13 Nov 23:59; Ship Sat 14 Nov 17:59 UTC |
| Baseline contains only disclosed LoanBook code | PASS | Pre-change `HEAD` was `940099e`; no CommonCircle/circle/vault/Rust artifacts in `git ls-tree -r HEAD` |
| Annotated baseline tag in original checkout | BLOCKED | Git rejected writing `.git/objects` in `C:\Users\HomePC\Documents\GitHub\Loanbook`; tag is pending there |
| Annotated baseline tag in writable working clone | PASS | `baseline-loanbook-port` is created at the pre-change commit in this clone |
| Secret material scan | PASS | `git ls-files` includes `.env.example` but no `.env`; scan for PEM private-key material returned 0 hits |
| Toolchain pins and lockfiles | BLOCKED | `.nvmrc`, `.bun-version`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, and `bun.lock` are present; no `Cargo.lock` exists because Cargo is unavailable, and the pre-existing `package-lock.json` is malformed binary data |

## Testnet verification requested by Gate 0

| Check | Status | Transaction hash / command output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ft_metadata` on both USDC IDs and `storage_balance_bounds` | BLOCKED | v3 pins mainnet `17208628f84f5d6ad33f0da3bbbeb27ffcb398eac501a31bd6ad2011e36133a1` and testnet `3e2210e1184b45b64c8a434c0a7e7b23cc04ea7eb7a6c3c32520d03d4afcb8af`. Read-only RPC attempts on 2026-11-10 failed with `The SSL connection could not be established` / curl could not connect, so symbol/decimals/storage bounds are not claimed. Circle's published list and SDK identify native USDC as 6 decimals: https://www.circle.com/multi-chain-usdc/near and https://docs-w3s-node-sdk.circle.com/variables/chains.NEAR_TESTNET.html |
| NEP-366 brand-new account joins and repays through a relayer | UNVERIFIED | Requires a funded testnet relayer/member workflow and a disposable account; no transaction was run |
| Sputnik factory by global contract hash and Transfer proposal | UNVERIFIED | v3 identifies the 6 NEAR standard-factory path and `sputnikv2.testnet` fallback but does not pin a global contract hash. No DAO account, proposal, gas measurement or transaction was run |
| NEAR Intents destination delivery, exact output, refund address | PASS (docs only) | Read 2026-11-10: https://docs.agentsonintents.com/integration/distribution-channels/1click-api/swap-types documents destination `recipient`, `EXACT_OUTPUT`, `refundTo`, and refund of short/excess deposits; https://docs.agentsonintents.com/integration/agent-api/funding documents deposit-address delivery and notes that the agent-deposit API refunds to the agent balance with no selectable refund address. No live swap was run |
| Event indexer reads a NEP-297 test event | UNVERIFIED | No test contract/indexer query was run |
| NEP-413 phone-browser sign-in with a mobile wallet | UNVERIFIED | Requires interactive phone wallet approval; no sign-in was run |

## Local Gate 0 checks

| Check | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claims harness reads `evidence/evidence.json` | PASS | `npm run claims` prints a Markdown table, writes `EVIDENCE.md`, and updates the README marker table with no verified tracks |
| Claims harness wrong-hash behavior | PASS | `npm run claims:test` accepted a matching snapshot and rejected a deliberately wrong expected transaction hash |
| Circle scaffold tests | BLOCKED | Rust/Cargo is not installed in the execution environment; tests are intentionally red placeholders for all 17 v3 README rows |
| `npm ci` clean install | FAIL | `npm ci` rejected the committed `package-lock.json` because it is not valid JSON/lockfile data; npm cache-routed lockfile regeneration was attempted but could not complete due registry/cache host restrictions |
| Existing LoanBook checks | FAIL | `npm test`/`npm run check`/`npm run test:contracts` could not run without dependencies; `npm run test:db` additionally fails because pre-existing `scripts/test-db.mjs` contains non-text bytes beginning `59 AA E7 8A 78 2D AE E9...` |

## Evidence format

`evidence/evidence.json` uses a minimal schema until the missing v3 schema is
supplied. A claim must include an `id`, `track`, `feature`, `claim`, `status`,
and an `evidence` array containing only reproducible commands, transaction
hashes, URLs, or committed artifacts. Allowed statuses are `PASS`, `FAIL`,
`UNVERIFIED`, and `BLOCKED`.
